# Starts from a simple project with:
# - platform tools already installed,
# - but the dependencies not installed.

# Dune and dune-release are dependencies of the simple project.

# This test tests the behaviour of:
# - installing dependencies on top of the tools:
#     dependencies should replace the tools if there is a clash
# - installing the tools on top of dependencies
#     tools should not replace a package if it is installed
